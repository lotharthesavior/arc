# Arc

Arc is a Rust framework for building event-sourced Actix Web applications.

Start here:

```bash
cargo install arc-web-cli
arc new my-app --ui
cd my-app
make setup
make dev
```

This documentation covers the application you receive from `arc new`: what is included, where to put your code, and how to build working features with published Arc APIs.

## What Arc gives your application

- An Actix Web server configured through `ArcApp`
- SQLite event, snapshot, read-model, and session storage
- A `CommandBus` that loads aggregates, persists events, and publishes them
- In-process projections with read-after-write consistency
- Cookie-session, rate-limit, compression, tracing, and path middleware
- Application-owned migrations and environment configuration
- Optional Tera page and static assets with `--ui`

## What Arc does not currently generate

- Authentication or user accounts
- CRUD/resource generators
- Multiple aggregate types in one generated runtime
- Postgres setup
- NATS and Benthos distributed event routing (**work in progress**)
- Admin pages or deployment configuration

Those are not implied by `--ui`.

## Build something

- [Create an application](getting-started.md)
- [Understand every generated source file](project-structure.md)
- [Follow request, domain, view, and form lifecycles](workflows.md)
- [Add an endpoint](endpoints.md)
- [Build an event-sourced resource](resources.md)
- [Add a server-rendered page](ui.md)
- [Test the application](testing.md)
- [Fix common startup problems](troubleshooting.md)
